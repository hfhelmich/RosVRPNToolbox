# RosVRPNToolbox

This repository holds class, function, and script files for the OptiTrack system in the Viper Lab at the United States Naval Academy (USNA). The Motive software that detects rigid bodies in the Viper workspace
actively streams the pose data of said rigid bodies. VRPN objects subscribe to these topics and give the user pose, quaternion, and translation data.
